# website-project

This is a Full stack project for practice. The back end is built with Flask and Python, using SQL to manage queries. The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Future work

I hope to add more features to this project in the future, including:
* Using React to make website more user friendly
* Expand back end code to allow for more complex uses
